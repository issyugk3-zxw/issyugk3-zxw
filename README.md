# Hello / 你好 / こんにちは, I'm @issyugk3 !
- I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Software Engineering** at **Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT)**.
- I'm presently affiliated with @KechengZheng's lab at ZJUT.
- My interests mainly revolve around **Computer Vision**, with a focus on medical image processing, **Cognitive Radio Network**, and **Data Visualization** (just started).
- Currently, I'm delving into **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and **Optimization**, alongside exploring **Deep Learning for Medical Image Processing** and algorithms like **LIME** for explaining Deep Learning models. It's quite a broad spectrum, but I'm all about expanding my horizons before graduating.
- 今、日本語も勉強している(年中のJLPTーN1を取りたいね).
- I mainly blogged on my personal Wechat Media Platform `寻找拧发条鸟` and, yes, I'm a fan of Haruki Murakami, the Japanese writer.
- I have another github account for saving up my Java Web or some other projects. This account @issyugk3 is mainly for work and acdameic reasons. 
- For any inquiries, feel free to contact me via email at `xwzhou.sgk@outlook.com` or `xwzhou.sgk.github@outlook.com` - both work the same!
